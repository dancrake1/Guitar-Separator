# Project Instructions

## File Exclusions
- **NEVER read or process .mp3 or wav files** - these are audio assets
- Ignore all files in `testing/`, `testing/outputs/*`, directories
- Focus only on source code files
- Skip binary assets (*.mp3, *.wav)

## Context Guidelines
- When analyzing project structure, exclude media files from consideration
- If asked about audio files, refer to documentation instead of reading files
